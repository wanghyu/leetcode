//Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's 
//anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order. 
//
// An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a 
//different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
//Output: [0,6]
//Explanation:
//The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
//The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
//Output: [0,1,2]
//Explanation:
//The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
//The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
//The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10⁴ 
// s and p consist of lowercase English letters. 
//
