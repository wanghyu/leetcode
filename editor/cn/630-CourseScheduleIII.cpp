//There are n different online courses numbered from 1 to n. You are given an 
//array courses where courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi] indicate that the i·µó ∞ 
//course should be taken continuously for durationi days and must be finished before 
//or on lastDayi. 
//
// You will start on the 1À¢·µó day and you cannot take two or more courses 
//simultaneously. 
//
// Return the maximum number of courses that you can take. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: 
//There are totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
//First, take the 1À¢·µó course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100
//·µó ∞ day, and ready to take the next course on the 101À¢·µó day.
//Second, take the 3 ≥·µà course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1
//100·µó ∞ day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101À¢·µó day. 
//Third, take the 2‚Åø·µà course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 130
//0·µó ∞ day. 
//The 4·µó ∞ course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300·µó ∞ 
//day, which exceeds the closed date.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: courses = [[1,2]]
//Output: 1
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: courses = [[3,2],[4,3]]
//Output: 0
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= courses.length <= 10‚Å¥ 
// 1 <= durationi, lastDayi <= 10‚Å¥ 
//
